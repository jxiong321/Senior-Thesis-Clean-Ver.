## Abstract

This project investigates how state-level high school math graduation requirements affect studentsâ€™ self-perception of mathematical ability and long-term STEM retention, with a particular focus on gender differences. Using NCES longitudinal data (ELS:2002), I employ Difference-in-Differences (DiD) and matching methods to estimate causal effects. Results show that increasing math requirements from 3 to 4 years has a significant positive effect on self-efficacy, but suggests heterogenous impacts by gender, highlighting the importance of designing accessible and appealing math education policies.
